# WP2_pilot

Pilot study of Sgr B2 in preparation for WP2 of ACES. Below outlines the workflow
for team decomposition of the Sgr B2 data.

Workflow
--------

1. Clone github repo using ``git clone https://github.com/ACES-CMZ/WP2_pilot.git``
2. Download relevant data from globus including ``HC3N_TP_7m_12m_feather.fits``
   and ``HC3N_TP_7m_12m_feather.mask2d.fits``
3. Move data cube and mask into local repo (.gitignore will prevent them from
   being uploaded to github post-decomposition)
